# DCGAN
DCGAN (Deep convolutional generative adversarial networks) is one of the popular and successful network design for GAN. It mainly composes of convolution layers without max pooling or fully connected layers. It uses convolutional stride and transposed convolution for the downsampling and the upsampling. The figure below is the network design for the generator.
